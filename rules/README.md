# Flickslate custom rules

For now to support tabs.

### Important

From the [documentation](https://detekt.dev/docs/1.23.8/introduction/extensions):

*Sometimes when you run detekt task, you may not see the violations detected by your custom rules. In this case open a terminal and run ./gradlew --stop to stop gradle daemons and run the task again.*

Or use --no-daemon.
