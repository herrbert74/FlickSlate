# FlickSlate

An Android app using the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started).

The goal of FlickSlate is to showcase best practices and learn some new techniques.

It also showcases some of the techniques used in my articles about [caching](https://herrbert74.github.io/posts/caching-strategies-in-android/) and [architecture](https://herrbert74.github.io/posts/architecture-related-decisions-introduction/)

## üìö Tech stack

- Application entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
- UI developed in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose)
- Following the [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) guidelines
- Asynchronous processing using [Coroutines](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/)
- Dependency injection with [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) and [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)
- Database using [realm-kotlin](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin)

## üèõ Architecture

FlickSlate architecture is Clean(ish) Architecture as [recommended by Google](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

Let's take a look in each major part of the application:

* **presentation** - Contains the **ui**, the **design** and the **navigation**. 
* **domain** - Contains the **domain model** and the **api interface** It depends only on itself and all interaction it does is via _dependency
  inversion_.
* **data** - The module containing the data (**db**, **network**) from the app. Also holds the **repository** implementation.
